title: Welcome to Maptime Cape Cod!
---

Maptime Cape Cod is a meetup where members can teach and learn about different geospatial technologies, work collaboratively on projects, and showcase their mapping successes. Suffice it to say, Maptime is a time for maps. We encourage an open learning environment for anyone **regardless of experience**. Anyone with an interest in a specific topic or, more broadly, mapping is welcome to attend. At its core, Maptime is all about learning from our peers to build a community of modern day cartographers on and around Cape Cod. That said, we ask you come to Maptime with your personal development in mind-- please leave work projects at *work*.

We anticipate that Maptime Cape Cod will meet monthly at various locations around the Cape and possibly the south coast. Feel free to [contact us](mailto:maptimecapecod@gmail.com) with suggestions for future meetup topics, or if you know of any locations that can host us. 

We look forward to seeing you!
