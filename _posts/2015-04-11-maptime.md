Our first Maptime meetup will take place Saturday April 11 from **8am - 12pm** at the [**Woods Hole Research Center**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Woods+Hole+Research+Center/@41.549525,-70.643438,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89e4d83670aa5e8b:0x48ca2661041bed5a). We will be working through the basics of [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) by contributing to the [Spring OSM Mapathon](http://openstreetmap.us/2015/01/2015-mapathons/). Although the Mapathon theme is "Great Outdoors", we'll be living the [#SlouchLife](http://twitter.com/SlouchLife) by adding our favorite hiking trails, fishing holes, and secret beach spots to the map from our chairs.

Please RSVP so we can accommodate everyone who wants to attend-- anyone *even remotely* interested in mapping is welcome! Remember to charge your laptop then head over to the Research Center for a morning of mapping and getting to know each other.
