Let's take a month to focus on the design component behind modern day cartography! Modern day cartographers face design options every time they style a map whether it be within a software framework or through CSS and CartoCSS. Picking successful color ramps, palettes, text styles, shadowing effects, etc. can be challenging for everyone.

Well, join us to hear about these artistic choices and the process behind them from local artists through their work! These are the trained professionals that produce beautiful pieces that create conversations surrounding the places we love. They are so important to our community and so very talented in what they do!

Please join us at Cape Cod Beer for an artistic maps night with local artist(s)! Joining us will be Katherine Hallam, owner of Whimsical Notions based out of the village of Gray Gables in Bourne. An example of one of her pieces can be found at http://bit.ly/1duiROq.

We are hoping to announce at least one additional artist who will be joining Katherine and will keep you up to date as the date approaches. Please join us in gaining a very valuable perspective from local artists!

Please RSVP so we can accommodate everyone. **Bring a map you like that you didn't make** so that we can all discuss. As always, **EVERYONE is welcome**!
