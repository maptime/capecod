title: Maptime 3 - Spatial Data Formats

So you have some spatial data. Maybe it's a GPS track from your last run, photos embedded with the location where they were taken, parcel data for your town, or data from a scientific expedition. Have you ever given any thought to the format that the data are stored in?

Join us for June's Maptime Cape Cod meetup where we will discuss various spatial data formats (shapefiles, GeoJSON, databases, and more!), the benefits and drawbacks of different format types, how to choose the right format for you, and how to translate between formats.

Bring your laptop. The evening will be a mix of learning and hands-on data exploration!

Please RSVP so we can accommodate everyone. **Bring your laptop** so that you can follow along and contribute. As always, **beginners are most welcome**!
